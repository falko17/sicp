# SICP Exercises
My implementations of the exercises in [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://sarabander.github.io/sicp).

I chose[^1] Racket as the programming language to do this, which helpfully has an [`sicp` package](https://docs.racket-lang.org/sicp-manual/) nowadays for full compatibility with the Scheme variant used in the book.
I will try to go through every single exercise, but we'll see how realistic that actually is.
Otherwise, I can recommend [Eli Bendersky's blogposts about SICP](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/tag/sicp), and there are extensive solutions in the [Scheme Wiki](http://community.schemewiki.org/?SICP-Solutions) (although the latter contains a few arguments/back-and-forth in some places[^2]).
